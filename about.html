        <p class="bio">
            I have worked as a writer, reporter, and photographer in activist and multimedia journalism for the past
            15 years, with a diverse range of experiences in Damascus, Beirut, and Berlin. During this time, I have
            extensively covered events in Syria since 2011 and reported on happenings in Iraq and Lebanon as well.

            <br /><br />

            In addition to my journalistic work, I have also made notable contributions to various cultural events. One
            of my significant accomplishments was my participation in "Another Place," an audio walk performance that
            took place in multiple cities, including London, Berlin, Brussels, Beirut, and Santiago.

            <br /><br />

            I am the author of the book titled "Table Ground," which was published by the Syrian Association for
            Citizenship in 2014. Furthermore, I authored a guidebook on citizen journalism in conflict areas, which was
            published by Friedrich Ebert Stiftung in 2016.

            <br /><br />

            I received Samir Kassir Award for Freedom of the Press in 2013. Beyond my journalistic roles, I have also
            taken on responsibilities as a project manager for various international organizations.

            <br /><br />

            Currently, I am working as a sub-grant lead at SMEX.
            I continue to contribute to various media platforms through my writing and reporting.
